Sandbox Car Generator

Description:
This is an updated auto-generator, which was inspired by an older project.
If you do not have any ideas of what to build, this is what you're looking for!
The key difference is that this can run without Python 3.6 install.

Issues:
Incompabitility with some bodies and engine placement. (Currently WIP);

Roadmap:
Planned to be update as long as there are updates on the game itself.
